I (Julia Ross) teamed up with Jackson Codd for the Bowdoin Sophomore Bootcamp Hackathon to 
create a website that helps craft a cover letter for a student applying for a job (in the spirit of
what we learned during BootCamp!). Although the generative AI is still in its initial stages, we are
quite proud of our UI and usage of MongoDB to create a user/password system.
